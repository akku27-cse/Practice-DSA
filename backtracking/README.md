# Backtracking ♟️

Description
- Problems solved using backtracking techniques such as permutations, combinations, N-Queens, Sudoku solver, etc.

Guidelines
- Each file should implement one problem with clear function entry points and comments explaining the backtracking approach.
- Include complexity analysis: typically exponential time for most backtracking solutions.

How to contribute
- Add problems with clear names (e.g., `NQueens.java`) and test cases in comments or a separate `tests/` folder.
