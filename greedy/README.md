# Greedy Algorithms ⚡

Description
- Greedy technique problems (e.g., activity selection, coin change variants, interval scheduling).

Guidelines
- For each solution, explain the greedy choice property and why it is optimal.
- Typical complexities vary — include time & space complexity.

How to contribute
- Add problems with examples and justify the greedy approach in comments.
