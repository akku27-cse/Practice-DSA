# rsion (Revision / Practice) 🔁

Note
- This folder name appears to be short for "revision" or "revision-practice" — consider renaming to `revision/` or `practice/` for clarity.

Purpose
- Use this folder to store small practice snippets, quick revisions, or utilities used across problems.

Guidelines
- Keep small helper snippets here. Add a short header in each file explaining its purpose.
