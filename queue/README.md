# Queue 📋

Description
- Queue implementations and related problems: standard FIFO queue, circular queue, sliding window, BFS-related utilities.

Guidelines
- Include examples on how to use queue-based solutions and expected input formats.
- Add both array-backed and linked-list backed implementations if relevant.

How to contribute
- Name files with problem details and include complexity analysis.
