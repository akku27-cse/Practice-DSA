# String 🧵

Description
- String problems and utilities: pattern matching, substring/search, anagrams, palindromes, rolling hash/KMP, and more.

Guidelines
- Include problem statement and examples in file comments.
- Mention algorithm used (KMP, Rabin-Karp, two-pointer, sliding window) and complexity.

How to contribute
- Name files descriptively (e.g., `LongestPalindromicSubstring.java`) and include sample test cases.
