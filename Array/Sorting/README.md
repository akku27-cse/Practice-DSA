# Array / Sorting 🔢

This folder is for sorting algorithm implementations (currently empty).

Suggested files to add
- `BubbleSort.java`, `SelectionSort.java`, `InsertionSort.java`
- `MergeSort.java`, `QuickSort.java`, `HeapSort.java`

Guidelines
- Add a short description of the algorithm, complexity (time & space), and sample input/output.
- Prefer deterministic names like `MergeSort.java` so it's easy to find.

How to test
- Compile and run each file using `javac` and `java` or add a simple test harness.
