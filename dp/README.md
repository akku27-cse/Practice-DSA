# Dynamic Programming (DP) 🧠

Description
- Problems solved using Dynamic Programming: memoization and tabulation approaches (e.g., knapsack, LIS, coin change).

Guidelines
- State whether the solution is top-down (memoization) or bottom-up (tabulation).
- Include recurrence relation and complexity: typical polynomial time (often O(n*m)), plus space usage.

How to contribute
- Add one problem per file, include explanation and test cases in comments or a `tests/` folder.
